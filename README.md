## What is ClawSCAD?

ClawSCAD glues together [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) into a single desktop application. Tell Codex what to build, and it writes OpenSCAD code, renders it, validates the output, and auto-iterates until the model is correct  all while you watch in a live 3D viewport.

Every iteration is saved as an immutable checkpoint. You can click any checkpoint to go back, branch from it, and explore different design directions. Codex sees your full history and can reference any previous version.

## Features

**3D Viewport**
- PBR rendering with environment-mapped reflections
- Orbit, pan, zoom (mouse + touch + keyboard)
- Wireframe, edge overlay, orthographic/perspective toggle
- 7 camera presets (Front/Back/Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Iso)
- Click any part to see dimensions, volume, weight, estimated print cost
- 6 customizable color swatches for instant model coloring
- Screenshot export
- Split viewport  open a second 3D view with independent camera

**Checkpoint History**
- Every .scad file is an immutable checkpoint in a branching tree
- Click any checkpoint to instantly load its model (cached in memory)
- Branch from any point  Codex creates new files, never overwrites
- Collapsible tree with box-drawing connectors
- Right-click context menu: rename, delete, collapse, view source, resume session
- Hover tooltips showing the change description

**Source Editor**
- Monaco editor with OpenSCAD syntax highlighting (Monarch grammar)
- Custom dark theme matching the app
- Find (Ctrl+F) and Replace (Ctrl+H)
- Read-only by default, toggle to edit mode
- OpenSCAD error markers (red squiggles on error lines)

**Codex CLI Integration**
- Embedded terminal running Codex CLI
- OpenSCAD MCP server auto-configured for every workspace
- AGENTS.md with mandatory rules: never overwrite files, use colors, validate with MCP tools
- Auto-iteration: when a render fails, ClawSCAD writes errors to RENDER_ERRORS.md and nudges Codex to fix them
- Session management: browse, resume, or start new Codex sessions
- Dual terminal support (up to 2 Codex instances)
- Multi-window support (up to 4 projects, Codex sees all workspaces)

**Export**
- STL, 3MF, and PNG export buttons in the header
- 3MF export preserves per-part colors (when OpenSCAD supports it)
- Print cost estimation with configurable infill, material, and cost/kg

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/levkropp/ClawSCAD.git
cd ClawSCAD
npm install
npm start
```

**Prerequisites:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html) installed and in PATH (or set `OPENSCAD_BINARY` env var)
- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed globally: `npm install -g @openai/codex`

## Usage

1. Launch ClawSCAD  it creates a workspace at `~/clawscad-workspace/`
2. Codex CLI starts in the terminal panel on the right
3. Tell Codex what to build: *"Make a gear with 20 teeth and a shaft hole"*
4. Codex writes a .scad file, ClawSCAD auto-renders it in the 3D viewport
5. If the render fails, ClawSCAD tells Codex to fix it automatically
6. Click any checkpoint in the History panel to go back and branch
7. Use the color swatches to try different colors instantly
8. Export to STL/3MF when you're happy with the design

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+N` | New viewport (split view) |
| `Ctrl+F` | Find in source editor |
| `Ctrl+H` | Find and replace |
| `F5` | Force re-render |
| `1`-`7` | Camera presets (when viewport focused) |
| `R` | Reset view |
| `F` | Zoom to fit |
| `W` | Toggle wireframe |
| `E` | Toggle edges |
| `O` | Toggle ortho/perspective |
| `+`/`-` | Zoom in/out |
| `Escape` | Deselect part |

## Architecture

```
ClawSCAD
 main.js          Electron main process  multi-window, project state, render queue, MCP client
 renderer.js      3D viewport (three.js), terminal (xterm.js), editor (Monaco), checkpoint tree
 preload.js       IPC bridge between main and renderer
 index.html       Layout
 style.css        Dark theme
 icon.png         App icon
```

- **Rendering**: OpenSCAD CLI (`openscad -o output.3mf input.scad`), tries 3MF first (preserves colors), falls back to STL
- **3D engine**: three.js with MeshStandardMaterial, RoomEnvironment, EdgesGeometry, raycaster picking
- **Terminal**: xterm.js + node-pty, spawns `codex` directly
- **Editor**: Monaco with custom Monarch grammar for OpenSCAD
- **MCP**: Spawns `openscad-mcp-server` as a JSON-RPC subprocess for direct render/validate access
